•  Wiring the Water Sensor:
•	VCC pin of the water sensor to 5V on the Raspberry Pi.
•	GND pin of the water sensor to Ground on the Raspberry Pi.
•	OUT pin of the water sensor to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 22).
•  Wiring the LED:
•	Anode (long leg) of the LED to a resistor (220 ohms) and then to another GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 27).
•	Cathode (short leg) of the LED to Ground on the Raspberry Pi.
